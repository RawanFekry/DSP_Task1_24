- All graphs are implemeted using plotly. <br>

## Features
> General Information
- Our website will give you multiple features to analyze your signals:
  > As our website is designed for :
  - plotting your desired signals by determine signals frequency and amplitude.
  - Add Multiple signals at the same time and show the final output signal.
  - Upload signal from your files in csv formateand show it.
  - Remove any signal you have added by selecting and deleting it.
  - Add noise to your signal by determine signal to noise ratio(SNR) Which has a range if SNR=0 that means noise is extrem and if SNR=50 that means signal will appear without noise.
  - sample your signal with 2 options:
  > By determine frequency you want in HZ OR
  > By sampling with Max_frequency Scale (I wnant to sample with fmax,2fmax.....,10fmax)
  - reconstruct your signal and this has more one option (you can't reconstrict it nicely if your sampling frecency <2fmax (according to nquist's law ), and you can reconstruct it well if sampling frequency >= 2fmax)
  - Our website provide saving each graph of your signal as png and zooming in or out, also you can doenload your reconstructed  signal in csv formate as well.
